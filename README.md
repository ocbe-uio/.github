# What is a `.github` repository?

A `.github` repository is a special repository in a GitHub organization or user account that can store community health files (like issue templates, pull request templates, and contributing guidelines) and configuration files that apply to all repositories in the organization. It helps centralize and standardize documentation and workflows across multiple projects.
